twitter-follower-metrics
========================

some small scripts for looking at metrics around twitter usage, mostly based off of @psychemedia's work.

# Setup the environment

`mkvirtualenv twitter-metrics`  
`pip install networkx`  
`pip install ipython`  
`pip install tweepy`  
`pip install yql`  
`pip install simplejson`

Create a file `privatebits.py` for storing keys, don't add it to your git repo!. See `privatebits-example.py` for the 
required format.
